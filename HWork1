1.Using  chipotle.tsv  in the  data  subdirectory: 
i.Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of the file contents.)
In initially assessing the layout of the data, the columns appear to be different variables about the different items that Chipotle offers in their menu, which are represented in the rows. It is important to note though that each order can have multiple items, thus resulting in multiple rows at times (e.g. order number 1 has 4 items within it - Chips and fresh tomato salsa, Izze, Nantucket Nectar, and Chips and chili salsa.

ii.How many orders do there appear to be?
There appears to be 1834 orders based on the order id variable --- "wc -w " used

iii.How many lines are in the file?
The file appears to contain 4623 lines including the column names ---- "wc -l " used

iv.Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken?
The chicken burrito (591 quantity) appears to be more popular than the steak burrito (386 quantity) "wc -w " used

v.Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans?
The chicken burrito with black beans (307 quantity) appears to be more prevalent than the chicken burrito with pinto beans (108 quantity) "wc -w " used

2.Make a list of all of the CSV or TSV files in the DAT7 repo (using a single command). Think about how wildcard characters can help you with this task.
" find . -name *.csv" and " find . -name *.tsv" used

3.Count the number of occurrences of the word 'dictionary' (regardless of case) across all files in the DAT7 repo.
"wc -w " used

4.Optional: Use the the command line to discover something "interesting" about the Chipotle data. The advanced commands below may be helpful to you!
"uniq <filename>" used to determine if everything on the menu has been ordered at least once across all the orders
